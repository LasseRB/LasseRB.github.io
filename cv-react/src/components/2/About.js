            <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>Iâ€™m a copenhagen based software developer, animator and master student. 
                
                 I am interested in all apsects of software development, 
                 but has mainly been focused on full stack web technologies. 
                 I love learning new things and is not afraid to be thrown into the deep end.
                  I have a past in character animation, drawing and art; although not technical in nature, I use these skills to aid me in design descisions. </p>
